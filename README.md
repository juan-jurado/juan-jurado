### I'm Entrepreneur, Developer, and a Teacher!

I'm EE (Electrical Engineer) with strong background on machine learning and Deep learning for AI solutions and robotics powered by embedded systems (ARM64) such as Jetson devices by NVIDIA. 


Experience as a self-driving cars engineer and embedded systems engineer at Kiwibot.com (self-driving robots for food delivery). Experience in computer vision, robotics, control, localization, path planning, sensor fusion, motion planning, CNNs/RNNs, and system integration using ROS I/ROS II. Experience in the hardware-software interface (I2C, UART, Analog/Digital signals, USB). High interest in robotics and artificial intelligence to build autonomous machines. Linux lover. 
I do not want to maintain the status quo. ¡Let’s create something great!.

<!--
**juan-jurado/juan-jurado** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on real-time video analysis using Deepstream and AI models using CNNs and Transformers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning low level code (C++14) to improve my current robotic skills.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects based on robotics and autonomous machines (AI at the edge + Robotics).
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with IDK
- 💬 Ask me about 
- 📫 How to reach me: ...
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to play guitar, drums and piano - still learning. I love learning a lot of tech things (nerd emoji). I used to play deep house and viking music while I'm coding. 

Let's connect (flecha de abajo emoji)
